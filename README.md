# Server-Essentials
Hello! I am a Computer Engineer with research orientation in Computer Architecture, Systems, Deep Learning and Cloud Computing. My day-to-day pipeline contains so much linux hacking and configurations. This repo contains some essential tools to do everyday engineering tasks a bit easier.

## 1. Jupyter Notebook Configuration
Ever wondered how to install and set up [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) properly with a password? The tutorial mentioned below will help you do exactly that ! Change the script to add more or edit the given configuration. We are going to launch Jupyter Notebok in all IP addresses associated by the system, in port 8888, with a password so that you can browse to the IP address in chrome and use notebook there.

## 2. Quick and easy Network File System (NFS) Configuration
NFS is a very handy tool to mount network drives into local compute nodes. The tutorial shows how to attach storage drives through network to your local machine.

## 3. Easy datacenter management by configuring IPMI
Abbreviated as IPMI the Intelligent Platform Management Interface was primarily developed by Intel in 1998 for remote management of servers and/or other systems via a network connection. If the server has IPMI configured and is connected to a power supply, the system administrator can send a variety of commands over the network to the server remotely. These commands can, for example, query the power state, power down or power up a server without physically operating it.

## 4. Creating and mounting Volumes in OpenStack cloud instances
Ever ran out os space in OpenStack cloud instances ? I know that feeling. Let us look into ways to attach OpenStack Volumes to running cloud instances. More storage is always welcome.
